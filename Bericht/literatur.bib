@article{Friendly.2005,
 abstract = {Of all the graphic forms used today, the scatterplot is arguably the most versatile, polymorphic, and generally useful invention in the history of statistical graphics. Its use by Galton led to the discovery of correlation and regression, and ultimately to much of present multivariate statistics. So, it is perhaps surprising that there is no one widely credited with the invention of this idea. Even more surprising is that there are few contenders for this title, and this question seems not to have been raised before. This article traces some of the developments in the history of this graphical method, the origin of the term scatterplot, the role it has played in the history of science, and some of its modern descendants. We suggest that the origin of this method can be traced to its unique advantage: the possibility to discover regularity in empirical data by smoothing and other graphic annotations to enhance visual perception.},

Eight sections have been arranged: Data Analysis and Classification. Neural Networks and Pattern Recognition. Statistical Models and Methods. Information Systems: Design and Implementation. Text Analysis and Information Retrieval. Applications in Medicine. Applications in Economics and Social Sciences. Applications in Archaeology, Biology, Linguistics and Dialectometry. The grouping shows how theoretical aspects, applications and interdisciplinarities are interrelated in many respects},

@book{Kunii.1987,
 abstract = {Recent developments in computer graphics have largely involved the following: Integration of computer graphics and image analysis through computer data structure; integration of CAD/CAM as computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) through the design and simulation of manufacturing processes using computer graphics; progress in basic research on the modeling of complex and mathematical graphic objects, such as computational geometry, graphic data bases, hierarchical windows, and texture; use of computer graphics as an improved human interface to present information visually and multidimensionally; and advancement of industrial technology and computer art based on developments in the areas listed above. These trends are strongly reflected in the contents of the present volume either as papers dealing with one particular aspect of research or as multifaceted studies involving several different areas. The proceedings comprise thirty selected, previously unpublished original papers presented in nine chapters},

@article{Schulz.2011,
 abstract = {Apart from explicit node-link representations, implicit visualizations and especially the Treemap as their frontrunner have acquired a solid position among the available techniques to visualize hierarchies. Their advantage is a highly space-efficient graphical representation that does not require explicit drawing of edges. In this paper, we survey the design space for this class of visualization techniques. We establish the design space along the four axes of dimensionality, edge representation, node representation, and layout by examining existing implicit hierarchy visualization techniques. The survey is completed by casting some light into regions of the design space that have not yet been explored. Our design space is not a mere theoretical construct, but a practically usable tool for rapid visualization development. To that end, we discuss a software implementation of the introduced design space.},
